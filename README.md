My programming test assignment for Wunder

This repo is for my test assignment for Wunder

# Architecture chosen:

i briefly, i have chosen MVC architecture because it's easy to implement the structure, and its well designed to separate the components.

the MVVM architecture  which i have worked with it before using Angular, but for now i need more time to learn how it will be integrated in Android as well.
So, i decided to work with MVC architecture because i'm familiar with it and faster to integrate it.

# Unit test

i have implement a unit test under the class ExampleInstrumentedTest the method check_JSON_Loaded_Correctly()

and that's for testing is the json file loaded correctly.

i user Instrumented Test because i need the Context to be done with the test.

# Splash screen

i have added a splash screen because i really like this feautre in Android

# Third party library

i have added a Fragment defines all Third party library used by this project including their licenses.
